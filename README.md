# Funkin' Chocolate

This is the repository for Funkin' Chocolate, a fork of the FNF Source Code that mainly touches up the game's gameplay.
Its concept mainly came from most FNF engines being either way too forgiving or way too competitive, and the idea of Chocolate is to be a middle ground.

# Goals

The main goals of this project are to improve the gameplay in a way that is not too extreme and resembles original FNF, but is enough that transitioning to other rhythm games is not difficult.
Besides that, it also aims to ease the moddability by use of Hscript, which is in a way inspired by the base FNF game.
